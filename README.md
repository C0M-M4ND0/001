# Jenkins Demo

This repository contains a React project that has been set up for the purpose of creating a demo about Jenkins. The project includes a Jenkinsfile, which is used to build a Docker image of the project and push it to a container registry.

# Jenkins Pipeline

This project includes a Jenkinsfile, which is used to build, test, and deploy the project. <br> The Jenkinsfile includes three stages:

- Build: This stage installs the project dependencies and builds the project using npm run build.

- Test: This stage runs the project tests using npm run test.-

- Build Docker Image: This stage builds a Docker image of the project and pushes it to Docker Hub. It includes a script that authenticates with Docker Hub using credentials stored in Jenkins.

To use this Jenkinsfile, you'll need to create a new pipeline job in Jenkins and point it to the Jenkinsfile in this repository. You'll also need to configure your Jenkins credentials for Docker Hub.
