# Jenkins Demo

This repository contains a React project that has been set up for the purpose of creating a demo about Jenkins. The project includes a Jenkinsfile, which is used to build a Docker image of the project and push it to a container registry.

## Jenkins Pipeline

The Jenkins pipeline is a powerful tool that can be used to automate the entire software development process. It allows developers to define the steps required to build, test, and deploy their projects, and then execute those steps automatically using Jenkins.

This project includes a Jenkinsfile, which is used to build, test, and deploy a Docker image of the project.<br> The Jenkinsfile consists of three stages:

### Build

The first stage of the Jenkins pipeline is the build stage. This stage installs the project dependencies and builds the project using the `npm run build` command. This ensures that the project is fully built and ready for testing.

The build stage is a critical part of the software development process. It ensures that all the necessary dependencies are installed and the code is compiled correctly before moving on to the testing stage.

### Test

The second stage of the Jenkins pipeline is the test stage. This stage runs the project tests using the `npm run test` command. This ensures that the project is fully tested and ready for deployment.

The testing stage is equally important as the build stage. It ensures that the code is functioning as expected and meets the necessary requirements and specifications.

### Build Docker Image

The final stage of the Jenkins pipeline is the build Docker image stage. This stage builds a Docker image of the project using the Dockerfile included in the repository. The Docker image is then pushed to Docker Hub using the credentials stored in Jenkins. This ensures that the project is fully deployed and ready for use.

The Docker image created in this stage is a self-contained package that includes all the necessary dependencies and code to run the application. It can be easily deployed to any environment that supports Docker containers.

To use this Jenkinsfile for your own project, you will need to create a new pipeline job in Jenkins and point it to the Jenkinsfile in this repository. You will also need to configure your Jenkins credentials for Docker Hub.
